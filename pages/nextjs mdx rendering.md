- There are several different approaches to [[MDX]] rendering in [[next.js]]
	- `@next/mdx` https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx
		- directly rendering `.mdx` files as pages / routes
		- pros: easy to get started
		- cons: layout is configured as default export, which is not easy to configure universal ones
	- `next-mdx-remote` https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote
		- a MDX compiler that can be easily combined with `getStaticProps`
		- we can use a standalone `[slug].tsx` to separate layouts and page contents
		- page content can be managed in another place, even remotely
	- `mdx-bundler` https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler
		- a MDX bundler ([[xdm]] with [[esbuild]])
		- the approach is very similar to `next-mdx-remote`, but it allows "import/export"
		- cons: the output size is 4x larger than `next-mdx-remote` according to https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote#:~:text=at%20least%20400%25%20larger
- ## 💡 How rendering works
	- The approach to `next-mdx-remote` and `mdx-bundler` is pretty similar. In the `[slug].tsx`
		- `getStaticPaths` to get the list of files to be built
			- use `fs` to traverse the posts folder and list all `.mdx`
			- use different `fallback` values to configure pre-rendering behavior for large number of files
			- can even combine with remote API calls
		- `getStaticProps` to get the mdx `->` **React Elements** for rendering
			- this is where `next-mdx-remote` and `mdx-bundler` starts to kick in. We can compile/bundle the mdx file here during the **build time**.
			- `next-mdx-remote/serialize` or `import {bundleMDX} from 'mdx-bundler'`
		- `render`
			- in `getStaticProps`, we have the MDX React elements **STRING** compiled. The elements will need the corresponding client to get rendered.
			- both libraries use `Function` constructor to wrap the element string and then evaluate them to the page
