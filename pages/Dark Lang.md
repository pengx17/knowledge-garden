- First impression
  - Using ^^UI diagrams^^ drawing in "canvas" to provide backend & API for the frontend and a ^^strongly typed DSL^^. Also, the language's ^^Autocomplete^^ is also great
  - Not sure if it is easy to share your code to others. Sharing the _Canvas_ seems very dangerous to me.
- Now in private beta. Created my account under namespace `pengx17` on [[Jul 30th, 2021]]
